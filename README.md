# Activity-2-Genetic-Algorithms

In this project we have configure two algorithms two solve "The Job Shop Problem or the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem"

We implemented two techniques: Genetic  and Simulated algorithms.
src repository contains the code for these two algorithms written in python 
data respository contains the data that we chose to work and test our models.
